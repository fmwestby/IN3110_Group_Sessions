# Git ignore
Tired of annoying/strange/unnecessary files showing up at git? 
- add a .gitignore file with all the files you do not want!


To much work? Use this lazy guide:

1. create a .gitignore in your repo / folder
2. go to https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore
3. write in OS (eg. macOS) and language (eg. python)
4. copy all the text to your .gitignore file
